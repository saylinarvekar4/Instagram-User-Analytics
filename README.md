Problem Statement:
Imagine you're a data analyst working with the product team at Instagram. Your role involves analyzing user interactions and engagement with the Instagram app to provide valuable insights that can help the business grow.
User analysis involves tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as a software application or a mobile app. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams within the business. For example, the marketing team might use these insights to launch a new campaign, the product team might use them to decide on new features to build, and the development team might use them to improve the overall user experience.

Loyal User Reward: The marketing team wants to reward the most loyal users, i.e., those who have been using the platform for the longest time.

Inactive User Engagement: The team wants to encourage inactive users to start posting by sending them promotional emails.
